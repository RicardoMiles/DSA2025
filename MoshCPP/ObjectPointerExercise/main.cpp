/*
    Define a class Student that contains member variables name and score, 
    and define a member function printInfo to print the student's information. 
    In the main function, dynamically create a Student object,
    and call the printInfo function through a pointer.
    Hint: Use new and delete.

    Define a class Car that contains member variables brand and year, 
    and define a member function getBrand to return the brand name. 
    In the main function, create a pointer to a Car object, 
    and call the getBrand function through the pointer.
    Hint: Pay attention to the initialisation and usage of the pointer.
